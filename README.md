## Features
- Add, remove, update, and search for tasks.
- Tasks are organized by date and can be sorted by priority, making it easy to manage deadlines and important tasks.
- Track task history and view basic task completion statistics, which can be displayed and deleted as needed.
- Data is stored and retrieved through file-based storage, supporting both CSV format and serialized objects. A CSV file with sample data is included for testing purposes.
- Robust error handling ensures the application is resilient to incorrect user input and malformed data in files.

## Data Storage
The project uses file-based storage, so no additional setup for databases or external services is required.
